# Data-Augmentation
Data augmentation is a technique of artificially increasing the training set by creating modified copies of a dataset using existing data. It includes making minor changes to the dataset or using deep learning to generate new data points.  

# Usage 
To prevent models from overfitting.
The initial training set is too small.
To improve the model accuracy.
To Reduce the operational cost of labeling and cleaning the raw dataset. 

# Image Augmentation
-Geometric transformations: randomly flip, crop, rotate, stretch, and zoom images. You need to be careful about applying multiple transformations on the same images, as this can reduce model performance. 
-Color space transformations: randomly change RGB color channels, contrast, and brightness.
-Kernel filters: randomly change the sharpness or blurring of the image. 
-Random erasing: delete some part of the initial image.
-Mixing images: blending and mixing multiple images.
